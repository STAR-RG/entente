/*
 *  There's a fast path when writing to Array instances, providing the
 *  following conditions are met:
 *
 *    - The key is numeric, and is an integer in the range [0,2^32-1],
 *      the range of allowed array indices.  For example arr[7] matches
 *      this condition, arr['7'] or arr['foo'] does not.
 *
 *    - The array is not sparse, i.e. the internal representation has an
 *      array part.
 *
 *    - The array is extensible, so that creating new properties is allowed.
 *
 *    - The array write would not grow the internal allocation for the
 *      array; the write -can- increase array ".length" but can't lead
 *      to a reallocation internally.  This condition cannot be known
 *      reliably from outside, of course.
 *
 *  When the fast path is activated, Duktape won't check Array.prototype
 *  for conflicting property values which might prevent a write (e.g. a
 *  non-writable or accessor Array.prototype["7"] would capture a write to
 *  "7").
 *
 *  For Ecmascript code is difficult to predict when the fast path is active
 *  because some of the conditions are related to internal state.  However,
 *  there's no reason to do that: as long as there are no conflicting numeric
 *  properties in Array.prototype there is no outward difference in behavior
 *  (regardless of whether or not the fast path is active for a certain write).
 *
 *  Test for the non-compliant default behavior.  You can restore compliant
 *  behavior by dropping the fast path; undefine DUK_USE_ARRAY_PROP_FASTPATH.
