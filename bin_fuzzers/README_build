* TODOs
	We should find out the equivalent of the v8 'dev' channel in the other tools

*** Engines ***

** v8: https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building-from-Source
 - recommended branch: 6.5.254.31 (stable/beta used in chrome for linux/windows)
 - follow the instructions on the link above with the following changes:
   - run "fetch --no-history v8"  to avoid downloading the entire repo
   - most likely you won't need all the stuff that
     "install-build-deps.sh' installs to compile v8. This script is
     used to install dependencies across *all projects under the
     chromium umbrella*.
   - checkout the recommended branch with "git checkout 6.5.254.31; git pull"
 - status: ok
 - <checkout-dir>/v8/out.gn/x64.release/d8
   - You'll also need to copy the .bin files contained in the folder
     if you want to move the binary.

** spidermonkey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation
 - recommended branch: mozilla-beta tip 
    - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Mercurial
 - problem: ‘PRLibSpec’ was not declared in this scope 
   - reason: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441454
   - workaround: '../configure --enable-nspr-build'
 - status: OK
 - <checkout-dir>/gecko-dev/js/src/build_OPT.OBJ/dist/bin/js <file>

*** DONE why is the js binary so big? (224 mb)
 - debug info (check out with the 'bloaty' tool from google)
   - strip it with 'strip --strip-uneeded' - should bring the size down to 24MB

** javascriptcore: http://constellation.github.io/blog/2016/05/02/how-to-build-javascriptcore-on-your-machine/
 - recommended branch: https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/tags/Safari-606.1.9.1/
   - closest thing I could find to a "beta" release
 - status OK
 - testsuite: includes chakra/mozilla
 - <checkout-dir>/WebKitBuild/Release/bin/jsc <file>

** chakra: https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore
 - recommended branch: release/1.9
 - status OK
 - <checkout-dir>/ChacraCore/out/Release/ch <file>

** Nashorn: included with JDK 8/9
 - recommend installing latest version of JDK 9
 - status OK
 - run 'jjs' after installing JDK 8/9

** rhino: https://github.com/mozilla/rhino
 - status OK/Deprecated?
   - replaced by Nashorn in the latest JDKs
 - testsuite: same as spidermonkey?
 - supports: ES6 (not complete?) - maybe Nashorn is a better alternative?
 - java -jar <checkout-dir>/rhino>/buildGradle/libs/rhino-1.7.9-SNAPSHOT.jar <file>
