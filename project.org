* Problems
** How to store information about partial executions?
 - avoid starting from scratch every time
 - important for mutation-based fuzzers

** How to output valid js from esprima's AST?
 - use an external generator

** DONE why does esprima.parse raises an error when executed from an interactive prompt?
 - TypeError: %b requires bytes, or an object that implements __bytes__, not 'str'
 - maybe it is a bug on objects.__repr__? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr-in-python 
 - yep, see this pull request: https://github.com/Kronuz/esprima-python/pull/7/files
   Apply the patch to your local copy and everything should work fine

* Ideas
** TODO Filter implementation-specific behavior before calling fuzzers
*** behavior list
 - [X] drainMicroTasks in JavascriptCore
   - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/v8-users/fCkwCNTsN8M
   - https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/jsc.cpp#L1895
 - [ ] v8 runtime functions (%foo())
   - Needs a flag at startup anyway; maybe we don't need to worry. https://stackoverflow.com/a/14863721
   - haven't seen it yet at the current suite
   
** TODO Blacklist uninteresting failures from short logs
*** List 
? 

* Smaller tasks
* Snippets
** dumping esprima's AST
 - python -m esprima your-js-file
