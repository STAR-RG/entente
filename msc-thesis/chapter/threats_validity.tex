\chapter{Threats to Validity}

As it is the case for most empirical evaluations, our findings are
subject to internal, external, and construct validity
threats.
\section{Internal Validity}
Considering internal validity, conceptually, it is possible
that the authors of this paper made mistakes in the implementation of
the scripts supporting the experiments. To mitigate this threat, we
carefully inspected the implementation and results, looking for
inconsistencies whenever possible.

\section{External Validity}
As for external validity, our
results might not generalize to other test inputs and engines. To
mitigate this threat, we carefully selected inputs from various
sources according to a well-defined criteria. Likewise, we selected
the engines by using using a well-defined criteria and found that the
engines selected were associated, certainly not by coincidence, with
the browsers informally considered the most popular in the market.

\section{Construct Validity}
In terms of construct validity, we used standard metrics to determine the
effectiveness of the testing techniques we studied (\eg{}, number of
bugs confirmed and fixed and severity). Engine developers were
responsible for determining the labels of the bug reports and their
severity. Consequently, these metrics originate from a trusted source.
