Funfuzz Description: Each iteration of the main funfuzz loop (called
"localoop" from the main log) fuzzes the binary of a different
spidermonkey configuration. For example, 32bit debug mode, 64bit
deterministic, etc. In each iteration, four separate threads are
spawned to run tests in parallel in a fork-join style, i.e., the next
loop iteration only begins when all these threads finish
execution. The function many_times_runs is the entrypoint of
jsfunfuzz. it is reponsible to run *js*funfuzz on each iteration. It
is very important to note that this function inlines all dependent
JavaScript files (see funfuzz/js/files_to_link.txt) in a single .js
file, which corresponds to the jsfunfuzz file. The function "driver"
is executed in this file

sequence of calls:
 funfuzz/bot.py:main
 funfuzz/util.fork_join.py:forkJoin
 funfuzz/bot.py:loopFuzzingAndReduction
 js/loop.py:many_times_runs

argument of a call to many_timed_runs: 1 /tmp/tmpxJlbKBloop0 [u'--repo=/home/damorim/trees/mozilla-central', u'--build=', u'--random-flags', '24', u'mozilla-central', PosixPath('/home/damorim/shell-cache/js-64-linux-e14a35f977a8/js-64-linux-e14a35f977a8')] <Collector.Collector.Collector object at 0x7f05ef8dfa10> False

Comments:

The execution above will build different versions of SpiderMonkey
under the directory ~/shell-cache. The jsfunfuzz file that is used to
generate input is stored under /tmp/funfuzz/src. This file is executed
in the SpiderMonkey binary. It produces js files and executes them.

Important:

The jsfunfuzz file stored under /tmp (see comment above) contains a
list of test files that **I assume are for mutation**.  These are test
files from the mozilla-central directory (downloaded by the script
above). Two related comments:

  - There are several tests in this list that we do *not* use (see
    jit-tests). We may want to use those to extend our dataset.

  - If my assumption above (about jsfunfuzz mutating existing inputs)
    is correct, we may want to use jsfunfuzz in the future as we use
    radamsa/quickfuzz.
