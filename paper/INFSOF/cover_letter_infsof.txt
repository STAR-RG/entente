Dear Editors, 

We would like to submit the manuscript entitled "Leveraging Diversity
to Find Bugs in JavaScript Engines" to the "Information and Software
Technology" journal. We kindly ask you to consider the submission as a
Journal First Publication.

JavaScript is a very popular programming language today with several
implementations competing for market dominance. Although a
specification document and a conformance test suite exist to guide
engine development, bugs occur and have important practical
consequences. Implementing correct engines is challenging because the
spec is intentionally incomplete and evolves frequently. This paper
evaluates two complementary diversity-aware techniques considering
ability to find bugs and cost. Results indicate that both techniques
were effective. They revealed several bugs, many of which confirmed by
engine developers. We reported 27 bugs with test transplantation (18
of these bugs confirmed and 12 fixed) and reported 22 bugs with
differential testing (15 of these confirmed and 10 fixed). To
summarize, our results show that diversity-aware techniques are easy
to apply and very effective in finding bugs in complex software, such
as JavaScript engines.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration
for publication elsewhere. It reports completely new research results
and does not extend prior work.

Sincerely yours,

Igor Lima, Breno Miranda, and Marcelo d'Amorim
